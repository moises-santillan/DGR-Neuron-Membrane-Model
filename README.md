# DGR Neuron Membrane Model

This repository contains the raw data, code, and data-analysis results corresponding to the manuscript *Mouse DRG sensory-neuron membrane fluidity is affected by diabetes mellitus*, which has been submitted for publication to *Frontiers in Physiology*.

Raw data consists in .txt files with cell-deformation recordings. The first colum in such files corresponds to the time at which measurements where made, the second column contains the pressure exerted upon the cell membrane (in kPa), and the third column has the corresponding deformation distance (in μm). Raw data is organized in two directories, corresponding to cells from mice in the control group (ctrl) and from mice in which diabetes mellitus was induced with streptozotocin (stz).


The repository also contains the code we used to fit an ad-hoc mathematical model of the cell mechanical response to the experimentally obtained data, as well as the obtained best-fitting parameter values for both experimental groups.
